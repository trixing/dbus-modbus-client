# Modified version with ET340 total phase sum support

Addresses wrong measurements e.g. in German grid where the total of phases is important

## Custom Install

Install is a bit cumbersome, one possibility:

* cd /data
* git clone ...
* cd dbus-modbus-client
* cp /opt/victronenergy/dbus-modbus-client/{vedbus.py,ve_utils.py,settingsdevice.py} .
* edit /opt/victronenergy/service-templates/dbus-modbus-client.serial/run to point to the new location
* disable dbus-cgwacs by editing /etc/venus/serial-starter.conf rs485 to `alias rs485 modbus`

# dbus-modbus-client

Reads data from Modbus devices and publishes on D-Bus.  Service names and
paths are per the [Victron D-Bus specification](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus).

Modbus devices using the RTU, TCP, and UDP transports are supported.

## VregLink

With some devices, the [VregLink](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus-api#the-vreglink-interface)
interface is supported.

The VregLink interface uses a block of up to 125 Modbus holding registers
accessed with the Modbus Read/Write Multiple Registers function (code 23).
Byte data is packed into 16-bit register values MSB first. All accesses
start from offset zero in the VregLink block. The base address is device
specific.

### Write

| Offset | Field   |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0      | VREG ID |
| 1      | Size    |
| 2..N   | Data    |

A write operation contains the VREG to access and, optionally, data for
setting the value. The size field indicates the length in bytes of the
data and must be 2x the number of registers or 1 less. To select a VREG
for a subsequent read, only the first field (VREG ID) should be present.

### Read

| Offset | Field   |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0      | VREG ID |
| 1      | Status  |
| 2      | Size    |
| 3..N   | Data    |

A read operation returns the value of the selected VREG or an error code if
the access failed. The size field indicates the length of the data in bytes.
The actual size of the VREG value is returned even if the requested number
of registers is too small to contain it.

### Status

The following status codes are possible.

| Value  | Meaning                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 0      | Success                      |
| 0x8000 | Read: unknown error          |
| 0x8001 | Read: VREG does not exist    |
| 0x8002 | Read: VREG is write-only     |
| 0x8100 | Write: unknown error         |
| 0x8101 | Write: VREG does not exist   |
| 0x8102 | Write: VREG is read-only     |
| 0x8104 | Write: data invalid for VREG |

### Examples

If the VregLink register block begins at address 0x4000, then to read
VREG 0x100 (product ID), the following Modbus transaction would be used.
